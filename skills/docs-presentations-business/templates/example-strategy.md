## Situation Assessment

**What you have:**
- [List concrete assets: skills, demos, data, relationships, track record]

**What you're up against:**
- [List constraints: politics, budget, leverage, timing, team dynamics]

**Core strategic insight:**
> [One sentence that captures the essence of your pitch — not WHAT you know, but WHAT IT'S WORTH to them]

Example: "Your pitch is NOT 'I know AI tools.' Your pitch is 'I can compress the team's learning curve from 6-12 months to 6-8 weeks, and here's the proof, here's the plan, and here's what it's worth.'"

## Presentation Architecture

Total target duration: **[X] minutes** ([audience constraint reasoning])

```
[Phase 1: HOOK]          X min  — [purpose]
[Phase 2: CONTEXT]       X min  — [purpose]
[Phase 3: OPPORTUNITY]   X min  — [purpose]
[Phase 4: EVIDENCE]      X min  — [purpose]
[Phase 5: ASK]           X min  — [purpose]
```

**The psychological sequence:**
1. HOOK creates buy-in ("this is real")
2. CONTEXT creates urgency ("the market is moving")
3. OPPORTUNITY creates greed ("we could apply this everywhere")
4. EVIDENCE creates confidence ("the math works, the risks are managed")
5. ASK creates momentum ("here's exactly what to do")

## Phase Guidance (per phase)

For each phase, document:
- Slide-by-slide plan (title, purpose, one-liner)
- Key data points and their sources
- Transition language to the next phase
- Potential questions and prepared answers

---

## Blindspots and Attack Vectors

For each blindspot, document:

```markdown
### Blindspot N: "[The objection in their words]"
**Their argument:** [What they'll say]
**Why it's dangerous:** [Why this could derail the proposal]
**Your counter:** "[Exact words to say in response]"
```

**Common blindspot categories:**
1. "We can do this ourselves" — The DIY objection
2. "This changes too fast" — The timing objection
3. "You're just [skill], not engineering" — The credibility objection
4. "The ask is too aggressive" — The scope objection
5. "What if you leave?" — The key-person risk
6. Leverage asymmetry — Constraints you can't say out loud
7. Team resistance — Engineers who feel threatened
8. Over-promising — Setting expectations you can't meet
9. IP and ownership — Who owns what you've built
10. Security and compliance — Data protection concerns
11. "We're giving away our IP" — The mindset objection

---

## Audience Playbook

### DO:
- [Communication patterns that work for this audience]

### DON'T:
- [Communication patterns that fail for this audience]

### The Power Move:
> [Specific moment in the presentation designed to land maximum impact — usually after the demos, before the data]

---

## Preparation Checklist

```
Pre-presentation:
- [ ] All demos rehearsed [N]+ times with fallback recordings ready
- [ ] All financial calculations independently verified
- [ ] All data points sourced and sources memorized
- [ ] Employment agreement reviewed for IP implications
- [ ] All blindspot responses rehearsed out loud
- [ ] Backup slides prepared and accessible
- [ ] Timer tested for total presentation length

Day-of:
- [ ] Tech setup verified (projector, demos, slides)
- [ ] Backup demo recordings loaded and tested
- [ ] Water, notes, clicker ready
- [ ] First slide loaded, black screen until you start
```

## Appendices

Use appendices for deep-dive research that supports the presentation but doesn't belong in the main strategy document:

- **Appendix A**: [Deep topic 1] — detailed research, sources, methodology
- **Appendix B**: [Deep topic 2] — pricing tables, deployment options, comparison data
- **Appendix C**: [Deep topic 3] — market trajectories, hardware roadmaps, trend analysis

Appendices serve two purposes:
1. Preparation depth — if someone asks a detailed question, you have the answer
2. Follow-up material — can be shared after the presentation as supporting documentation
